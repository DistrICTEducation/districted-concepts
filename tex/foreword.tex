	Hello world!

I guess it is the typical title for any introductory tutorial when learning a computer language. This text serves as an introduction to some of the fundamental concepts to understanding information technology today and is largely based on the courses I have taken during my studies. I wanted to create some sort of summary of the most important ideas that form my current understanding of information technology, both for myself as a work of reference, but also to the reader as an aid in his or her quest to become a IT specialist.

IT projects require creativity and logical reasoning. Large IT projects may involve stakeholders from many different backgrounds. Large corporations have integrated IT as an itegral part of their core activities, as strategic use of IT can generate significant business value. IT has become an inevitability in today's society with the automation of many administrative and industrial tasks.

At the same time, a single programmer can easily write small applications by him/herself. Since the arrival of the personal computer, any person could start programming and creating his/her own tools or diversions from behind the desk in his/her bedroom. Thanks to the Internet, access to information has exploded and as smart devices become the norm, general interest for this kind of technology has grown.

"IT" is everywhere.
