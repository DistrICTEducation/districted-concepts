\quote{Hello world!}

I guess it is the typical title for any introductory tutorial when learning a computer language. This text serves as an introduction to some of the fundamental concepts to understanding information technology today and is largely based on the courses I have taken during my studies. I wanted to create some sort of summary of the most important ideas that form my current understanding of information technology, both for myself as a work of reference, but also to the reader as an aid in his or her quest to become a IT specialist.
